# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by A.J. Lozano 2/06/19

## ab_data.csv and countries.csv
> The dataset was provided by Udacity
The data is used to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The company has developed a new web page in order
to try and increase the number of users who "convert" and end decide to pay for the companys product.  


## Summary of Findings
Based on the simulations run in parts 1, 2, 3, we do not have statistical evidence to reject the null. 
The P-values in each of the simulations were above our alpha of .05. Using current data, the new page does not warrant any further resources at the moment. A switch may be pursued if new factors like additional countries, a newer rendering 
of the landing page, running the study for a longer time period and or looking at different time releases are added to our data.
Resources should be devoted to understanding why a test subject may or may not have converted depending on their page. 
If a particular day of week or a particular type of customer (age, gender, area of living) has more conversion rate, we can either try to get more customer in that day or type, or try to understand why the other day/type doesn't work well and fix that.
